# Club sandwich

## Ingredients

4 rashers streaky bacon
3 slices white bread
1 tbsp mayonnaise
1 hard-boiled egg, sliced
1 tomato, sliced
few thick slices chicken or turkey breast
small handful salad leaves
handful crisps, to serve, if you like

## Directions
Heat grill to High and cook the bacon, turning halfway through, until crisp. Toast the bread and spread one slice with the mayo.
Layer on the egg, tomato and bacon, then top with another slice of bread. Add the chicken or turkey, bacon, then lettuce. Finish with the final slice of bread and cut into quarters. Secure with cocktail sticks and serve with crisps, if you like.
